1. REVISION HISTORY 

            Readme  
Date        Version      Revision Description
=========================================================================
19SEP2012   1.0          Initial Xilinx release.
=========================================================================
2. OVERVIEW

This readme describes how to use the files that come with XAPP890.

The design implements a Sobel edge detection algorithm starting with C code.
The Vivado HLS tool generated RTL for this algorithm is used in the 
Zynq-7000 AP SoC Targeted Reference Design.

3. SOFTWARE TOOLS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

* Xilinx ISE System Edition 14.2
* Vivado HLS 2012.2

4. DESIGN FILE HIERARCHY

The directory structure underneath this top-level folder is described 
below:

\.
 |   Source files for the Sobel edge detection algorithm. This includes
 |   algorithm C files, testbench files and test images.
\sobel_rd_prj
 |   This folder contains project files for Vivado HLS tool. 
 |   Opening this directory in Vivado HLS will start the project.
 
5. INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS 

1) Install the Xilinx ISE System Edition 14.2
2) Install Vivado HLS 2012.2
3) Follow the steps in XAPP890 to generate the RTL for the algorithm

6. SUPPORT
